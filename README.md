# DataScience_Project_1
## We are Team 3

Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM methodology:

Business Understanding: Objective is to build a model that accurately predicts mobile phone prices.
Data Understanding: Collecting data on mobile phone prices and features.
Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming data.
Modeling: Using regression models like logistic regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression.
Evaluation: Using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE.
Deployment: Integrating the model into an app or website.
Exploratory Data Analysis
The project includes exploratory data analysis on features like RAM, battery power, and number of cores, with visualizations to understand their distribution and correlation with price ranges.

Results
Logistic Regression was found to be the most effective model for mobile price prediction due to its efficiency with large datasets and robustness to noise.
